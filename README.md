# PhoneNow-Customer-Churn-Analysis

#### This is a continuation of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship through Forage.

A few weeks after presenting the call center dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from PhoneNow reached out directly. He was impressed by the dashboard and asked if I could put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

1) Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
2) The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
3) Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
4) We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
5) We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

The analysis covers the following:
1) Data Preparation,
2) information on Customer demographics,
3) Customers' chosen services,
4) Customer account information,
5) Root Cause Analysis to help the telecom understand what type of customers are usually at risk based on the characteristics of already churned customers provided in the dataset, and
6) Recomendations were provided on how PhoneNow can improve on its services to reduce customer churn.

The dashboard can either be dowloaded via github or viewed [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMTA5NzQ5MzUtZDhiZC00YTNiLWIzMjItMThiZTZlYjFkYTVjIiwidCI6IjhiYWJhZjczLWVmYTgtNDU0OS04MGY3LTM3OThiZGVhNTZhNCJ9)
